# Starbucks-Capstone-Project

The data simulates how people make purchasing decisions and how those decisions are influenced by promotional offers.

Each person in the simulation has some hidden traits that influence their purchasing patterns and are associated with their observable traits.

People produce various events, including receiving offers, opening offers, and making purchases.

As a simplification, there are no explicit products to track. Only the amounts of each transaction or offer are recorded. There are three types of offers that can be sent: buy-one-get-one (BOGO), discount, and informational.

BOGO offer: a user needs to spend a certain amount to get a reward equal to that threshold amount.
Discount: a user gains a reward equal to a fraction of the amount spent.
Informational offer: there is no reward, but neither is there a requisite amount that the user is expected to spend.
Offers can be delivered via multiple channels: Email, Mobile, Social, Web

# Installation
The code should run without issues using Python 3.*. All the necessary libraries were imported using the Anaconda distribution.

# Project Motivation

GOAL: To use the data to

a) Identify which groups of people are most responsive to each type of offer.

b) How best to present each type of offer?

c) How many people across different categories actually completed the transaction in the offer window?

d) Which individual attributes contributed the most during the offer window?

# File Descriptions

There is one jupyter notebook available here to showcase the work related to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in explaining the individual steps.

# Results
The results of this analysis are available on a medium post [here](https://uikenna97.medium.com/a-survey-on-developers-in-nigeria-f7f1380f61ff)
